# API Server Backend Setup

## Introduction

This repository contains the backend boilerplate code for setting up an API server using Node.js and MongoDB. It provides a foundation for building RESTful APIs with user authentication, including OTP-based login via email. Follow the instructions below to set up the server and customize it for your needs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed locally or remotely

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd backendBoiler
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Before starting the server, configure the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template. The `.env` file should contain:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
DB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
OTP_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
OTP_PASSWORD="your_email_password"
```

### Notes:

- `DB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used to sign JWT tokens for user authentication.
- `OTP_EMAIL` and `OTP_PASSWORD`: Email credentials for sending OTPs using Nodemailer.

Make sure to replace these values with your actual configurations.

## Running the Server

Once the environment variables are set and dependencies installed, start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You should see a message in the console confirming the server is running.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **Register a new user**  
  `POST /auth/v1/signup`

- **User login**  
  `POST /auth/v1/login`

### User Management

- **View user details**  
  `GET /auth/v1/user`

- **Update user details**  
  `PATCH /auth/v1/user`

- **Delete user**  
  `DELETE /auth/v1/user`

### OTP Authentication

This server supports OTP-based email authentication using [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/). The OTP is sent to the registered email during user registration or login.
